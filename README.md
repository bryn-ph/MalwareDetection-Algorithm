# Malware Detection Bayesian Network Model

This Python program implements a Bayesian Network model for malware detection based on code characteristics, resizing behavior, signature presence, and malware outcome probabilities.

## Description

The Bayesian Network model represents the probabilistic relationships between different variables involved in malware detection. It takes into account factors such as code type (plain-text, binary, obfuscated), resizing behavior, presence of a signature, and the likelihood of the outcome being malware or software.

## Usage

1. Install the `pomegranate` library if not already installed: pip install pomegranate

2. Clone the repository to your local machine.

3. Run the program by executing the following command:

4. The program will calculate probabilities and predictions for different scenarios of code characteristics, resizing behavior, and signature presence.

## Example

```python
low_probability = model.probability([["plain-text", "yes", "absent", "malware"]])
print("Low Probability:", low_probability)

medium_probability = model.probability([["binary", "no", "absent", "malware"]])
print("Medium Probability:", medium_probability)

high_probability = model.probability([["obfuscated", "yes", "present", "malware"]])
print("High Probability:", high_probability)

predictions = model.predict_proba({"code": "plain-text", "resize": "yes", "signature": "present"})
low_probability_prediction = predictions[3].parameters[0]['software']
print("Low Probability Prediction:", low_probability_prediction)

predictions = model.predict_proba({"code": "plain-text", "resize": "yes", "signature": "present"})
high_probability_prediction = predictions[3].parameters[0]['malware']
print("High Probability Prediction:", high_probability_prediction)
